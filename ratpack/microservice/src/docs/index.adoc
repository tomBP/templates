[introduction]
= Introduction

Basic template for writing microservices with Ratpack, Spring Boot and Groovy.

[[overview-http-verbs]]
== HTTP verbs

The microservice tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and Rest conventions in its
use of HTTP verbs.

|===
| Verb | Usage

| `GET`
| Used to retrieve a resource

| `POST`
| Used to create a new resource

| `PUT`
| Used to update an existing resource, overwrites all fields

| `PATCH`
| Used for partial updates to an existing resource

| `DELETE`
| Used to delete an existing resource
|===

[[overview-http-status-codes]]
== HTTP status codes

The microservice also tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and Rest conventions in its
use of HTTP status codes. For example,

|===
| Status code | Usage

| `200 OK`
| The request completed successfully

| `201 Created`
| A new resource has been created successfully. The resource's URI is available from the response's
`Location` header

| `204 No Content`
| An update to an existing resource has been applied successfully

| `400 Bad Request`
| The request was malformed. The response body will include an error providing further information

| `404 Not Found`
| The requested resource did not exist

| `405 Method Not Allowed`
| The type of request for this resource is not allowed. For example, some endpoints may be GET only.
Trying a POST will return this message.
|===

For more status codes, see the https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html[w3 standard]

[[overview-errors]]
== Errors

Whenever an error response (status code >= 400) is returned, the body will contain a Json object
that describes the problem as demonstrated by the examples below. In a development or integration
environment the message may contain more detailed information.

=== Validation Error Example

include::{snippets}/validation-errors/http-request.adoc[]

include::{snippets}/validation-errors/http-response.adoc[]

include::{snippets}/validation-errors/response-fields.adoc[]

=== Validation Error Codes

Each validation error is identified by an error code and accompanied by a details property which
lists any constraint values. This makes it easier for a client to process the error
without having to parse the message.

|===
|Code|Description

|VE1| The field exceeds the maximum integer value
|VE2| The field is less than the minimum integer value
|VE3| The field cannot be null
|VE4| The field doesn't match the required pattern
|VE5| The string is either too short or too long
|VE6| The field is not a valid email
|VE7| The field is not a valid url
|VE8| The field is not in the correct date format
|VE9| The field must be unique

|===

===  Not Found Example

Errors other than validation errors have the same structure but without sub errors.
